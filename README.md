In this submission, work conducted for METU MMI727 course project is demonstrated. In this project, **Show, Attend, and Tell** image captioning model is examined. Implementation available in [A PyTorch Tutorial to Image Captioning](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning) is taken as a baseline and different improvement strategies are examined. The baseline model and 5 modified models are trained on MSCOCO image captioning dataset. These 6 models are benchmarked and compared on the test set of MSCOCO.

Please refer to paper for technical details and `showAttendTell.ipynb` for practical details. Link to a mini-dataset and checkpoints are in the link below:
